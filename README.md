# Hand Gesture Interactive Super Mario Bros 3

This application serves as an exploration of hand gestures in video games. Our objective was to transform the game, Super Mario Bros 3, into an interactive experience using hand gestures. Leveraging Unity for game development and Python with OpenCV for hand mapping, we aimed to redefine classic gameplay through gesture-based interactions.
